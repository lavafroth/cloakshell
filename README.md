Powershell reverse shell via WebSockets

#### ⚠️ Work in progress ⚠️
This project is very much a work in progress. Call it a proof of concept if you
like. The output does not start immediately. For some reason I haven't figured
out yet, one has to enter a newline (or a couple) to receive the output.

If you know better ways to implement this, hit me up with a PR.
